        <p>The rain reminds me of my roots on Earth.<br/>A holy hush settles absolute on Earth.</p>

        <p>Clouds heave in their heavenly bellies<br/>mute rain destined to shoot on Earth.</p>

        <p>Clouds come undone with petrichor<br/>and nourish the thirsty fruit on Earth.</p>

        <p>A floral fog births echoing promises.<br/>The echoing promises run loose on Earth.</p>

        <p>A round cradle sustains me. The rain reins me<br/>back to this perfect truth on Earth.</p>

<h2>train in the rain / departure</h2>


<p>Train in the rain;<br/>
cherish the quiet swelling</p>

<p>as I breathe up<br/>
tracks to immediate London.</p>

<p>Mind the gap<br/>
fills my brain,
each
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
drop.</p>

<p>Blind concrete routes<br/>
polluted, I pine as I<br/>
fall…</p>

<p>come home?</p>

<p>In an abstract sense<br/>
I am a pine tree<br/>
rooted in failure.</p>

<p>Autumn<br/>
leaves.</p>

        <h2>musings standing at a station</h2>

        <p>Light and shade, colours overlapping until the end of time when
the train might decide to blur in and out.</p>

<p>Maybe our eyes are made for this express purpose, to quantify 
each passing cloud, focused on its geometric beauty.</p>

<p>Maybe each leaf that beseeches the London sky has sworn to 
dance in the drizzle, the golden ratio an abstract anthem tracing 
around its form. And maybe I should dissect summer’s colours 
slowly under my thumb rather than stay comfortably numb, 
texting you in a fit of repeating rain.</p> 

<p>Sunset collapses in on itself. I yawn at your reply.</p>

<p>The streetlights paint lemon parallelograms on the platform,
sketch some kind of sanctuary for me in the dark.</p>
